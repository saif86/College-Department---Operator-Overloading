# College-Department---Operator-Overloading
Operator Overloading in C++

## Problem Statement

Design a **CollegeDepartment** class. Include fields for the *department name* (for example "Mathematics"), the *department chairâ€™s name* (for example, "Dr. Ishaq"), an integer that holds the *number of classes* offered by a department (for example, 10), and a string pointer that points to the individual courses offered by the department (for example, "MAT101").
  * Create two constructors. The default constructor assigns appropriate default values to the fields. The other constructor accepts parameters for the department name, department chairâ€™s name, and number of courses and assigns them to their respective fields, and also prompts the user for the names of all the courses offered.
  * Overload an insertion operator for the class.
  * Overload > and < operators that compare CollegeDepartments based on number of courses offered.
  * Overload an = operator to assign one CollegeDepartment to another.
